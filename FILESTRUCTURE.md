# Nuxt File Structure

You'll find our Vue files in `components` and `pages`. The files are structured in the order: template, script, and style. One thing to note; we want to keep any and all styling in `<style>`. This means that we try not to use Tailwind's classes directly in a file's `<template>`. Rather, we make a class name, and in the file's `<style>`, call `@apply` on top of any extra styling.

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `composables`

The composables directory contains your [Vue.js composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html).

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/composables).

### `i18n`

`i18n` (short for internationalization), is where we store our locales for translating this site into different languages.

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).

### `lib`

This directory contains common files and utilities for the project. The subfolder `api` is extra special as the containing files are auto-generated with the `scripts/generate-api` script and `generate:api` package command (which calls that script).

### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `public`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/public/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `scripts`

This directory contains helpful scripts for the development of the project.

### `types`

This directory contains all the custom types for our use with Typescript.
