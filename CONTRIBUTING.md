## Style guide

### General

- Be inclusive, this is a project for everyone.
- Be descriptive, it can be hard to understand abbreviations or short-hand.
- Make sure that your components are _responsive_.

### Nuxt/Vue

- Comments should be full sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending with punctuation.
- Comments above a function should start with the name of the thing being described.
- Make sure any data and prop names are as descriptive as possible.
- Try to move any repetitive elements into child components to reduce clutter in parent components.
- Use `async await` for any asynchronous functions.
- Include proper error handling for any `async` functions.
- Make all components compatible with server side rendering when possible.

### Git

- Try to have an informative branch name for others eg. `SRW-{issue number}-{ghusername}`.
  - Do not make pull requests from `main`.
  - Do not include slashes in your branch name.
    - Nested paths can act strange when other people start looking at your branch.
- Try to keep commit line length below 80 characters.
- All commit titles should be of the format `{area} {optional sub-area}: commit description`.
  - This will help people reading through commits quickly find the relevant ones.
  - Some examples might include:
    - `profile header: add support for badges`
    - `leaderboard: adjusted sidebar spacing`
- Commits should be as [atomic](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/) as possible.
